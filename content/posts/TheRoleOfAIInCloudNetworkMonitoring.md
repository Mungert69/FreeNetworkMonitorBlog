In today’s evolving digital landscape, businesses are rapidly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud environments to enhance scalability, resilience, and performance. However, these complex infrastructures introduce new monitoring challenges—how can teams effectively track network health, security, and performance across multiple cloud platforms and on-premises systems? The Quantum Ready Monitor Assistant, acting as your AI-powered ally, makes this easy by automating tasks, aggregating data, and providing actionable insights everywhere your network lives.

Let’s walk through how you, as a user, might leverage the Quantum Ready Monitor Assistant to tackle hybrid and multi-cloud monitoring, all through a friendly and intelligent conversation.

User:  
I need to monitor several resources across AWS, Azure, and our on-premise network from one place. Can the Quantum Ready Monitor Assistant help?

Assistant:  
Absolutely! The AI assistant is designed to simplify monitoring in hybrid and multi-cloud setups. First, let's set up each environment’s endpoints for active monitoring. For your AWS and Azure services, you’ll likely use HTTP/HTTPS checks, while on-premises nodes can be checked via ICMP or other protocols supported by your network.

Let’s add an AWS application endpoint for uptime and SSL certificate monitoring.

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "my-aws-app.example.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "port": 443,
    "timeout": 59000,
    "email": "user@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

This action sets up monitoring for the HTTPS endpoint of your AWS app and ensures you’ll be notified promptly of any downtime or SSL issues.

Now, let’s do the same for your Azure service.

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "azure-service.example.net",
    "endpoint": "http",
    "port": 80,
    "timeout": 59000,
    "email": "user@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

And for your on-premises server, suppose you want to track basic connectivity.

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "192.168.100.10",
    "endpoint": "icmp",
    "timeout": 3000,
    "email": "user@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

With these three function calls, we’ve linked monitoring for all critical nodes, regardless of cloud provider or network location.

User:  
How do I see which services are up or if anything needs attention?

Assistant:  
Let me fetch the current status and alert summaries for all your monitored hosts:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "email": "user@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

This command retrieves live and summarized data, showing which resources across AWS, Azure, and your on-premise setup are healthy or need immediate attention. The AI aggregates this for easy review—if a host signals a problem, you’ll be instantly alerted.

User:  
Can I customize where and how the monitoring occurs? I’m also concerned about traffic bottlenecks between clouds.

Assistant:  
Absolutely! Special consideration in hybrid/multi-cloud is the perspective of the monitoring agent. You may assign specific agents to perform tests regionally—for example, monitoring cloud services from a "London - UK" agent and internal hosts from a local office agent.

Let’s review available agent locations:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```
```

Once you know your available agents, you can reassign monitoring for any host as needed for optimal, location-aware checks. For example, you can edit the Azure service monitoring to use a Frankfurt-based agent for Europe-centric insights:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "id": 2,
    "agent_location": "Frankfurt - EU"
  }
}
```
```

This flexibility lets you spot not only whether a service is available but if there’s degraded performance for users in specific regions—critical for multi-cloud visibility.
