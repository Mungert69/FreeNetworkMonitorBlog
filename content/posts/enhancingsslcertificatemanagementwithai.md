## Use Case 1: Checking SSL Certificate Validity

One of the primary tasks in SSL certificate management is to ensure that your certificates are valid and properly configured. The Network Monitor Assistant can help you perform this task effortlessly.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Check the SSL certificate for example.com."
- **Assistant:** "Running SSL check on example.com. Please wait..."
- **Assistant:** "SSL check complete: The certificate is valid and uses strong encryption."

This interaction demonstrates how the assistant can quickly verify the status of an SSL certificate, providing you with peace of mind regarding your website's security.

## Use Case 2: Monitoring SSL Certificate Expiration

SSL certificates have expiration dates, and failing to renew them can lead to security warnings and loss of trust from users. The Network Monitor Assistant can help you monitor these expiration dates and alert you when it's time to renew.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Add a new host with the address example.com for SSL monitoring."
- **Assistant:** "Host example.com has been added and is now being monitored for SSL certificate expiration."
- **User:** "When does the SSL certificate for example.com expire?"
- **Assistant:** "The SSL certificate for example.com expires on March 15, 2024. You have 30 days left to renew it."

By using the assistant to monitor expiration dates, you can proactively manage your SSL certificates and avoid any potential downtime.

## Use Case 3: Analyzing SSL/TLS Configuration

It's essential to ensure that your SSL/TLS configurations are secure and comply with industry standards. The Network Monitor Assistant can analyze your configurations and provide recommendations for improvement.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Analyze the SSL/TLS configuration for example.com."
- **Assistant:** "Running SSL/TLS configuration analysis on example.com. Please wait..."
- **Assistant:** "Analysis complete: The configuration is secure, but consider disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for better security."

This feature allows you to stay informed about your SSL/TLS configurations and make necessary adjustments to enhance security.
