1. Network uptime: This metric measures the amount of time your network is up and running. Frequent downtimes can indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed.

2. Bandwidth utilization: This metric measures the amount of network resources being used at any given time. High bandwidth utilization could indicate a bottleneck or a potential security threat.

3. Latency: This metric measures the time it takes for data to travel between two points on the network. High latency can lead to poor user experience and can indicate network congestion or hardware issues.

4. Packet loss: This metric measures the percentage of data packets that are lost during transmission. High packet loss can indicate network congestion or hardware issues.

5. Network traffic: This metric measures the amount of data being transmitted on the network. Monitoring network traffic can help identify unusual patterns and potential security threats.

6. Network security events: This metric measures the number of security events that occur on the network, such as intrusion attempts or malware infections.

7. Firewall performance: This metric measures the effectiveness of your firewall in blocking unauthorized access to the network.

8. Network device performance: This metric measures the performance of network devices such as routers, switches, and access points. Monitoring device performance can help identify hardware issues or bottlenecks.

9. User activity: This metric measures the activity of users on the network, including which applications and websites they access. Monitoring user activity can help identify potential security threats and policy violations.

10. Network capacity planning: This metric measures the amount of network resources available and helps identify when additional resources may be needed to support growth or increased demand.
