Website performance is crucial for user experience because it directly affects how quickly and easily users can access and interact with your website. Slow-loading pages, broken links, and other technical issues can frustrate users and cause them to leave your site, resulting in lost traffic and potential sales.

In addition, website performance also affects search engine rankings. Search engines like Google prioritize fast-loading sites in their search results, so if your site is slow, it may be penalized in terms of visibility.

Finally, a fast and reliable website can improve user trust and satisfaction, leading to higher engagement and conversions. By investing in website performance optimization, you can improve the overall user experience and achieve better business outcomes.
