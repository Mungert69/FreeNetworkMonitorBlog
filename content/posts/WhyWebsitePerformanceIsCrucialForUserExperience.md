Website performance is crucial for user experience because it directly affects how users interact and engage with a website. A slow-loading website, for instance, can frustrate users and lead them to abandon the site altogether. This negatively impacts the user experience and can ultimately lead to a loss of customers.

On the other hand, a fast-loading website can result in a positive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need quickly. This can lead to increased engagement, longer browsing sessions, and ultimately, higher conversion rates.

In addition, website performance can also impact search engine rankings. Google, for instance, considers page speed as a ranking factor. If a website is slow to load, it may not rank as high in search engine results, making it more difficult for users to find the site in the first place.

Overall, website performance is crucial for providing a positive user experience, increasing engagement, and ultimately, driving business success.
