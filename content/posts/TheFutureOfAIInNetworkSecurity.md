As organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and network security is reshaping how we defend our digital infrastructure. In this blog post, I’ll show you—through a step-by-step, dialogue-style example—how you can use the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) to monitor, analyze, and preempt network security incidents, leveraging some of the latest ML-driven features that point towards the future of AI in cybersecurity.

Let’s step into the shoes of a forward-thinking network admin who wants to harness emerging trends in machine learning for cybersecurity, using the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open).

User: I want to monitor my main application server for anomalies that could indicate security threats. Can I set that up to take advantage of the AI-powered analytics?

Assistant: Absolutely! Let’s get your application server added with monitoring enabled. Which monitoring endpoint best describes your service—HTTP, HTTPS, or do you want to try our ‘quantum’ endpoint for state-of-the-art tests?

User: Let’s use HTTPS for now. My server is apps.example.com.

Assistant: Great. I’ll add your server with HTTPS checks so we can start collecting both performance and security telemetry, which will also feed into our AI analytics pipeline.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "apps.example.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "port": 443,
    "timeout": 59000,
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```
Once this call is made, the server is now monitored using HTTPS checks. This data will also be available for our machine learning models to process, looking for unusual patterns or behaviors—such as outlier response times, certificate anomalies, or previously unseen geographic access.

---

User: Can I get a look at recent monitoring data with potential security anomalies highlighted by ML?

Assistant: Yes, I’ll pull the latest monitoring data and flag any records that our AI detected as anomalous or suspicious.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "apps.example.com"
  }
}
```
In the response, you’ll see normal telemetry alongside warnings or “flags” if the system’s ML models found anything unusual—such as sudden spikes in response time, multiple failed certificate validations, or location shifts in incoming requests, all of which could suggest a potential security issue.

---

User: I want a summary of all hosts where the AI models have detected an alert in the past week.

Assistant: No problem. I’ll query all hosts with the alert_flag set, filtering for the past week. This leverages the assistant’s integration with ML-based detection rules, keeping your focus on real threats.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "alert_flag": true,
    "date_start": "2025-06-10T00:00:00",
    "date_end": "2025-06-17T00:05:00"
  }
}
```
Any hosts returned here are those for which the assistant’s machine learning models—trained to spot behavioral and security anomalies—have detected something requiring your attention. The results guide you directly to priority issues, reducing noise and analyst fatigue, a key benefit of ML-driven security.

User: How can I improve detection for quantum-era security risks on these hosts?

Assistant: Excellent question. We can invoke the quantum expert LLM to assess your host for resistance to quantum-enabled attacks, ensuring your cryptography is future-proof. Would you like to run this assessment on apps.example.com?

User: Yes, please.

Assistant: I’ll initiate a quantum vulnerability assessment now.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_quantum_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Evaluate apps.example.com:443 for support of post-quantum cryptographic protocols and highlight any quantum-vulnerable services.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```
When complete, you’ll receive a detailed report—another AI-driven interaction that ensures even the latest network threats are not overlooked.
