  - "What is the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant used for?"
  - "How can I set up quantum-resistant encryption monitoring for my website example.com?"
  - "What key metrics does the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant track to assess quantum readiness?"
  - "Can I receive alerts if my server stops supporting quantum-safe encryption or if a downgrade is detected?"
  - "Is it possible to pause or disable the quantum monitoring for my website if needed?"
answers:
  - "The Quantum Network Monitor Assistant is used to identify, monitor, and respond to key metrics that determine whether a network or website is protected against quantum computing threats by using quantum-resistant encryption."
  - "You can set up monitoring by using the add_host function with parameters specifying your website address, the quantum endpoint, and your email. This will enable real-time checks on quantum resistance, including detection of quantum-safe TLS, supported algorithms, and protocol health."
  - "It tracks metrics such as quantum-resistant cipher suite usage (e.g., Kyber512), SSL/TLS versions supported, algorithm negotiation success or failure counts, handshake types, successful quantum-safe protocol connections, and alerts on protocol downgrade risks or legacy algorithms detected."
  - "Yes, the system can automatically send email alerts if it detects removal or downgrade of quantum-safe cipher suites, transitions to only classical encryption, or handshake and protocol negotiation failures that suggest quantum-vulnerable fallback."
  - "Yes, you can pause or disable monitoring by using the edit_host function with the 'enabled' parameter set to false, allowing you to modify your monitoring preferences as your needs change."

As quantum computing rapidly moves from theoretical to practical, keeping your digital assets secure requires more than standard monitoring—you need to keep a close eye on quantum-resistant encryption readiness. In this blog, we’ll walk through how you can use the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) to identify, monitor, and respond to the most important metrics that will determine whether your network stands up to quantum threats.

Let’s see how an actual interaction with the assistant would look as you move toward quantum-safe security.

User: I want to see if my website example.com uses quantum-resistant encryption. What do I need to monitor?

Assistant: Great question! The first step is to monitor whether your website supports post-quantum cryptography (such as Kyber512, Dilithium2, or other quantum-safe algorithms). You'll also want to track metrics like supported cipher suites, observed handshake types, successful connections using quantum-safe protocols, and any detected vulnerabilities to traditional or quantum attacks. Let’s set up quantum monitoring for your site.

To begin, I’ll add your website example.com for quantum endpoint monitoring:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

Here, the assistant is using the add_host function to set up real-time checks on quantum resistance. This function will scan example.com and report back metrics relevant to quantum readiness: detection of quantum-safe TLS, supported algorithms, and protocol health.

Assistant: I’ve set up monitoring for example.com on the quantum endpoint. Now, let’s retrieve the key metrics:

User: What does the analysis show about quantum readiness?

Assistant: I'll fetch the most recent quantum security data recorded for your site:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "example.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum"
  }
}
```
```

The get_host_data function asks the monitoring system for the latest quantum security scan for example.com. The data typically includes:

- Quantum-resistant cipher suite usage (e.g., Kyber512)
- SSL/TLS versions supported (is quantum-safe TLS present?)
- Algorithm negotiation success/failure counts
- Alerts on protocol downgrade risks or legacy algorithms detected

Once the results are returned, the assistant would interpret them:

Assistant: Here are the findings!

- Quantum-Safe Algorithms Supported: Yes, Kyber512 available.
- Quantum TLS Handshake Success Rate: 100% (no fallback to classic RSA/ECDSA detected).
- Certificate Details: Uses a quantum-resistant certificate.
- Alerts: No downgrade attempts or fallback to non-quantum ciphers.

User: Can I get an alert if my server stops offering quantum-safe encryption or if a downgrade is detected?

Assistant: Absolutely! The system can alert you automatically via email if it detects:

- Removal or downgrade of quantum-safe cipher suites
- Transitions to only classical encryption
- Handshake or protocol negotiation failures that suggest quantum-vulnerable fallback

If you ever need to pause or modify your monitoring, you can do so easily:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```
```

The edit_host function allows you to enable or disable monitoring as your needs change.

Summary

Using the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), it becomes simple to:

- Set up quantum-specific monitoring for any website or service
- Continuously track, at a glance, if post-quantum encryption is in place and active
- Get alerted fast if anything falls back to vulnerable, classical protocols

With these tools and key metrics—supported quantum algorithms, connection success rates, and timely alerts—you can feel more confident navigating the quantum future.
