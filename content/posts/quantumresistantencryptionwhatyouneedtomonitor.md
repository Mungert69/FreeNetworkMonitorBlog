As quantum computing rapidly moves from theoretical to practical, keeping your digital assets secure requires more than standard monitoring—you need to keep a close eye on quantum-resistant encryption readiness. In this blog, we’ll walk through how you can use the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) to identify, monitor, and respond to the most important metrics that will determine whether your network stands up to quantum threats.

Let’s see how an actual interaction with the assistant would look as you move toward quantum-safe security.

User: I want to see if my website example.com uses quantum-resistant encryption. What do I need to monitor?

Assistant: Great question! The first step is to monitor whether your website supports post-quantum cryptography (such as Kyber512, Dilithium2, or other quantum-safe algorithms). You'll also want to track metrics like supported cipher suites, observed handshake types, successful connections using quantum-safe protocols, and any detected vulnerabilities to traditional or quantum attacks. Let’s set up quantum monitoring for your site.

To begin, I’ll add your website example.com for quantum endpoint monitoring:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```
```

Here, the assistant is using the add_host function to set up real-time checks on quantum resistance. This function will scan example.com and report back metrics relevant to quantum readiness: detection of quantum-safe TLS, supported algorithms, and protocol health.

Assistant: I’ve set up monitoring for example.com on the quantum endpoint. Now, let’s retrieve the key metrics:

User: What does the analysis show about quantum readiness?

Assistant: I'll fetch the most recent quantum security data recorded for your site:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "example.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum"
  }
}
```
```

The get_host_data function asks the monitoring system for the latest quantum security scan for example.com. The data typically includes:

- Quantum-resistant cipher suite usage (e.g., Kyber512)
- SSL/TLS versions supported (is quantum-safe TLS present?)
- Algorithm negotiation success/failure counts
- Alerts on protocol downgrade risks or legacy algorithms detected

Once the results are returned, the assistant would interpret them:

Assistant: Here are the findings!

- Quantum-Safe Algorithms Supported: Yes, Kyber512 available.
- Quantum TLS Handshake Success Rate: 100% (no fallback to classic RSA/ECDSA detected).
- Certificate Details: Uses a quantum-resistant certificate.
- Alerts: No downgrade attempts or fallback to non-quantum ciphers.

User: Can I get an alert if my server stops offering quantum-safe encryption or if a downgrade is detected?

Assistant: Absolutely! The system can alert you automatically via email if it detects:

- Removal or downgrade of quantum-safe cipher suites
- Transitions to only classical encryption
- Handshake or protocol negotiation failures that suggest quantum-vulnerable fallback

If you ever need to pause or modify your monitoring, you can do so easily:

```json
```json

{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```
```

The edit_host function allows you to enable or disable monitoring as your needs change.

Summary

Using the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), it becomes simple to:

- Set up quantum-specific monitoring for any website or service
- Continuously track, at a glance, if post-quantum encryption is in place and active
- Get alerted fast if anything falls back to vulnerable, classical protocols

With these tools and key metrics—supported quantum algorithms, connection success rates, and timely alerts—you can feel more confident navigating the quantum future.
