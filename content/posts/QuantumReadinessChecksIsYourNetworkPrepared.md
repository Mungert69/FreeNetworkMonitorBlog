Is your organization prepared for the quantum future? As quantum computing advances, traditional encryption methods are increasingly at risk. With the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), you can easily evaluate your network’s readiness for these emerging threats. Let’s walk through a real-world example showing how the AI assistant automates quantum readiness checks in a few simple steps.

Step 1: Describe Your Quantum Security Concerns

User:  
I want to check if my website, securecorp.com, is vulnerable to quantum attacks. How can I verify if my encryption is quantum-safe?

Assistant:  
Great question! I'll walk you through how to test for quantum-vulnerable services and validate quantum-resistant encryption on your website. Do you have a preferred location or agent you want to run the assessment from (e.g., your region or a specific data center)?

Step 2: Choose the Right Monitoring Agent

User:  
Just run it from the default location, please.

Assistant:  
Perfect. I’ll proceed with our recommended monitoring agent for this assessment.

Step 3: Initiate a Quantum Readiness Test

The assistant now prepares to initiate a quantum vulnerability scan using the built-in expert. This step leverages the call_quantum_expert function and specifies the target along with the necessary quantum algorithm checks.

Here’s how the assistant handles it:
```json


{
  "name": "call_quantum_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Test securecorp.com:443 for quantum-vulnerable encryption algorithms and check for support of post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Confirm compliance with current quantum-resistant standards.",
    "agent_location": ""
  }
}
```

The call_quantum_expert function instructs the specialized quantum security engine to assess your HTTPS service at securecorp.com, focusing on common weak points such as TLS ciphers, and to look for modern, post-quantum cryptographic protections.

Step 4: Review the Quantum Assessment Results

Once the scan completes, the assistant explains the results in plain terms.

Assistant:  
The quantum readiness check is complete! Here’s a summary:

- If quantum-vulnerable ciphers (like RSA or ECC) are detected, I’ll let you know exactly which protocols and ports are affected.
- If post-quantum ciphers or protections (such as Kyber or Dilithium) are in place, I’ll highlight your strengths and compliance.
- If any recommended actions are needed (like upgrading TLS libraries or enabling PQC support), I’ll provide step-by-step guidance.

User:  
Is there anything I need to fix immediately?

Assistant:  
- If legacy encryption is still active, I’ll suggest how to disable it and implement quantum-safe alternatives.
- For further testing or more advanced networks, I can check other domains, ports, or internal hosts on request.

Step 5: Expand Checks to Your Full Network (Optional)

User:  
Can I run these quantum checks on other parts of my network, like my internal VPN or email gateway?

Assistant:  
Absolutely! For each new host or service, just provide the address and (optionally) the port. I’ll repeat the quantum readiness scan for every point you specify.

Example function call for another host:
```json


{
  "name": "call_quantum_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Test vpn.securecorp.com:1194 for quantum-vulnerable protocols and available post-quantum encryption.",
    "agent_location": ""
  }
}
```
