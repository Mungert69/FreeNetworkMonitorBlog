Automating Network Documentation with AI: A Step-by-Step Conversation

Keeping your network documentation current is a major challenge, especially in dynamic environments. With the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant, you can automate the creation and maintenance of network inventories and receive up-to-date data that could power network diagrams and asset documentation. Let’s walk through how this works in a real scenario—capturing interactions that use actual function calls provided by the assistant.

Meet Alex. They oversee a mid-sized network with dozens of monitored servers and endpoints spread across multiple locations. Alex wants a centralized, always-current list of hosts and their statuses to use for inventory and diagramming. Here’s how the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant can help!

Step 1: Retrieve the Complete Inventory

Alex: “Show me all devices my organization is monitoring. I want details for documentation.”

Assistant: “Absolutely! I’ll pull a detailed list of all currently monitored hosts, including their status, endpoints, and agent locations.”

Here’s the assistant making the function call:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

The get_host_list function returns a structured list of every monitored host, with rich configuration detail (addresses, types, locations, ports, status, etc.). Alex can now export this data directly or integrate it into a network diagramming tool.

Step 2: Filter for Recent Changes for Incremental Updates

Alex: “Can you show me which devices have changed in the last 24 hours?”

Assistant: “Sure, I’ll find hosts whose monitoring data was updated in the past day.”

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "date_start": "2025-06-20T00:00:00",
    "date_end": "2025-06-21T00:00:00"
  }
}
```

By fetching updates using get_host_data with a date range, Alex quickly identifies which machines have changed, making it easy to update only those in the documentation or diagram.

Step 3: Group Devices by Location to Map Topology

Alex: “I’d like to organize my network map by agent location. What are the active monitoring locations?”

Assistant: “Let me list all distinct agent locations monitoring your devices.”

First, the assistant fetches agent details:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

The assistant receives the current agent locations (e.g., “London - UK”, “New York - US”, etc.). Then, Alex can filter host lists by location:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "agent_location": "London - UK"
  }
}
```

Using this targeted data, Alex can visualize each section of the network according to its geographical or logical zone.

Step 4: Automatically Include New Hosts

Alex: “Can I get notifications or an updated list whenever a new device is added?”

Assistant: “Absolutely. You can schedule this process, or simply re-run the get_host_list call to always pull the latest inventory. Email alerts are built in for notable changes—just make sure your email is set!”

When new devices are added using the add_host function, they immediately appear in your inventory queries and can trigger email alerts for seamless documentation.

Step 5: Export or Integrate Data

Alex: “Can I export this data to my diagramming tool?”

Assistant: “Definitely! The output from get_host_list and get_host_data is in a structured format, perfect for CSV export, spreadsheet import, or feeding into APIs for diagramming and management tools.”

Conclusion

With a few simple commands (and their corresponding function calls), the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant helps you keep your network documentation, diagrams, and inventories up to date—without manual effort. The assistant’s automation means changes in your environment are captured in near real-time, making your documentation as dynamic as your network.
