Ensuring ongoing compliance with standards such as PCI DSS and HIPAA is a major challenge for organizations handling sensitive data. Fortunately, with the Free Network Monitor Assistant, you can automate many of the routine compliance checks that would otherwise require manual oversight. In this blog post, we’ll walk through a practical, dialog-style example showing how the Assistant can help you maintain your compliance posture — from initial setup to custom monitoring and automated reporting.

Let’s imagine a network administrator is responsible for multiple healthcare and payment processing servers. They need to fulfill regular PCI DSS and HIPAA checks, including monitoring secure connections, service availability, and SSL/TLS configuration. Here’s how the Assistant streamlines this workflow:

---

User:  
I manage several servers subject to HIPAA and PCI DSS. Can you automate SSL/TLS and uptime monitoring for compliance?

Assistant:  
Absolutely! We can set up automated checks for HTTP/HTTPS uptime (a PCI DSS control) and SSL/TLS (critical for both HIPAA and PCI). We’ll also be able to regularly assess for expired or weak certificates, and alert you to issues. Let’s start by adding your main healthcare server and payment gateway.

To begin, I’ll add both servers so we can monitor their HTTPS endpoints and ensure secure connectivity:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "healthcare-app.example.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "payment-gateway.example.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com"
  }
}
```

After these function calls, the Assistant confirms both hosts are set up for SSL/TLS certificate monitoring and uptime checks. The email address you provided ensures compliance alerts are routed to your inbox.

What about advanced compliance checks, like confirming strong ciphers or detecting protocol vulnerabilities?

Assistant:  
Great question! For advanced PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance, let’s run an AI-powered security assessment on your HTTPS servers. This assessment checks cipher strength, protocol support (e.g., disabling SSLv3, weak TLS), and certificate health.

First, we’ll choose a monitoring agent location (to perform scans from the relevant jurisdiction or local network, as required by compliance policy):

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": false
  }
}
```

Once you select your desired agent, we’ll instruct the security expert to assess strict compliance requirements on your target:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Perform a PCI DSS and HIPAA-compliant SSL/TLS assessment of healthcare-app.example.com. Confirm strong cipher suites, disable deprecated protocols, and verify certificate validity. I am authorized for this scan.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - US"
  }
}
```

When the assessment completes, I’ll summarize the findings and flag any compliance gaps — such as outdated certificates or use of insecure protocols — so you can take swift corrective action.

---

User:  
How can I see ongoing compliance status and get alerted if something changes?

Assistant:  
Easy! The Assistant can retrieve the current status of monitored hosts at any time:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "healthcare-app.example.com",
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

You’ll receive uptime statistics, current certificate details, and whether any compliance-related alerts have been triggered. If the system detects downtime, expired SSL certificates, or weak encryption, you’ll be notified immediately via email — allowing you to address issues before they lead to a reportable incident.

---

User:  
Can I customize these checks for new compliance standards or mandates?

Assistant:  
Of course! You can add, adjust, or remove endpoints and customize the type or frequency of checks at any time with the edit functionality. For instance:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "id": 123,
    "enabled": true,
    "endpoint": "https",
    "timeout": 30000
  }
}
```

This lets you rapidly respond to new compliance mandates, such as adding multi-factor authentication or quantum-safe encryption checks for upcoming standards.
