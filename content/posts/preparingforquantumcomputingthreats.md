questions:
  - "What is the first step in preparing my network for quantum-safe security?"
  - "How can I identify which services on my network are vulnerable to quantum attacks?"
  - "How do I test if my network endpoints support quantum-safe algorithms?"
  - "What is a recommended approach to planning upgrade timelines for quantum security?"
  - "How can I monitor my network after implementing quantum-safe upgrades?"
answers:
  - "The first step is to assess your current network security posture by retrieving a detailed list of all network hosts and services currently being monitored. This inventory helps you understand what assets you have and their configurations."
  - "You can filter your monitored hosts to find those using encryption methods that are not quantum-resistant, such as standard HTTPS relying on classical algorithms. This helps prioritize which systems need quantum-safe upgrades."
  - "You can schedule quantum security assessments by using tools like the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant to test critical endpoints for support of post-quantum algorithms such as Kyber512 and Dilithium2. The assistant provides reports indicating which hosts are secure or at risk."
  - "After identifying vulnerable assets, create a timeline prioritizing critical endpoints with immediate risks first, followed by less critical systems. For example, set quarterly goals to update mission-critical servers first, then email systems, and so on. Use alerting functions to track progress and compliance."
  - "Once services are migrated to quantum-safe protocols, you can add them to monitoring in quantum mode using the assistant’s add_host function. This ensures ongoing verification and alerts you if any endpoint falls back to insecure algorithms."

As organizations become increasingly aware of the threats posed by quantum computing to traditional network security, it’s essential to establish a robust, step-by-step timeline for upgrading security measures. In this blog post, we’ll walk through a practical conversation with the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) to plan, prioritize, and begin monitoring your network for quantum-safe compliance—a crucial starting point for any organization getting ready for the quantum future.

Step 1: Assess Your Current Network Security Posture

User: I need to know what assets are currently being monitored on my network.

Assistant: Absolutely! To get started, let’s retrieve a list of all the network hosts and services under monitoring. Here’s how I’d call the get_host_list function:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

The function returns a detailed overview of your monitored endpoints, including their addresses, protocols, and configurations. This gives you a clear inventory of what you already have in place.

Step 2: Identify Vulnerable Services That Need Upgrades

User: Which of my hosts are using encryption methods that aren’t quantum-resistant?

Assistant: Good question! Let’s filter your monitored hosts for those using standard HTTPS (which may rely on algorithms likely to be broken by quantum attacks).

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "endpoint": "https"
  }
}
```

This lets us pinpoint which systems need quantum-ready upgrades, so you can prioritize accordingly.

Step 3: Schedule Quantum Security Assessments

User: I want to know which of these HTTPS hosts are already quantum-resistant or need urgent attention.

Assistant: We can test your critical endpoints for quantum-safe algorithm support. For example, to test if mydomain.com:443 supports quantum-safe protocols, I’ll use:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_quantum_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Test mydomain.com:443 for support of post-quantum algorithms such as Kyber512 and Dilithium2.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```

Once the assessment is complete, I’ll provide a report indicating which hosts are secure, which are at risk, and what needs to change.

Step 4: Plan Upgrade Timelines

User: How do I create a timeline to address these vulnerabilities?

Assistant: After reviewing the quantum expert’s report, you’ll know which assets to upgrade first. Let’s document critical endpoints with immediate risks, followed by less critical ones. You might set quarterly goals—updating mission-critical web servers in Q1, email systems in Q2, internal services in Q3, and so on.

Tip: Use the monitor assistant’s alerting functions to track upgrade deadlines and monitor when endpoints are brought into compliance.

Step 5: Implement and Monitor Upgrades

Once you start migrating services to quantum-safe protocols, you can use the add_host function to start monitoring them in quantum mode:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "secure.example.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```

This ensures ongoing verification and alerts you about any fallback to insecure algorithms.

Conclusion

Preparing your network for quantum threats is a process, not a one-time task. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) helps you take inventory, assess risk, engage quantum security experts, and set a clear timeline for upgrades—all in a collaborative, workflow-oriented way.
