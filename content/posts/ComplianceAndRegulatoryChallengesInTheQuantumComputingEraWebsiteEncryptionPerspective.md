The quantum computing era has brought about unprecedented technological advancements, but also new challenges in the field of compliance and regulation. One area that is particularly affected is website encryption.

In the past, encryption technologies such as SSL/TLS have been used to secure web traffic by encrypting data transmissions between a user's browser and a web server. However, with the advent of quantum computing algorithms like Shor's algorithm can efficiently factorize numbers which pose an existential threat to current asymmetric cryptography that underpins our digital security infrastructure. Cryptographic primitive based on lattice-based cryptography remains unbreakable even if there are huge advancements in Quantum Computing.

This poses a serious regulatory challenge for businesses operating online, as many regulations require strong encryption protocols to protect sensitive user information. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in hefty fines and significant reputational damage.

Another issue is the lack of clear standards and guidelines for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While researchers continue working on developing PQC-friendly standards organizations like NIST already conducted open competitions inviting proposals from industry professionals towards standardizing PQC protocols aimed at providing robust cybersecurity mechanisms against future threats from Quantum Computing.

Overall, it's important for businesses to stay informed about advances in quantum computing and keep up-to-date on compliance requirements related to website encryption. The industry must adopt Post-Quantum Cryptography sooner than later both for encrypted communication channels as well as stored data protection before it becomes too late - or just move out of classical public-key encryptions altogether since we cannot predict when large-scale quantum computers will be available commercially..
