In today’s hyper-connected world, downtime—even brief—can have far-reaching consequences. The Free Network Monitor Assistant leverages AI to not only detect incidents like server outages but also guide users step-by-step through investigation and resolution. Let’s walk through a real-world scenario where the assistant proactively detects a server outage, analyzes the problem, and suggests actionable fixes.

The Journey Begins: Monitoring a Critical Web Server

User: “I want to start monitoring my primary website, mycompany.com, to alert me if it goes down.”

Assistant: “Great! I’ll add your server to the monitoring list and set up HTTP checks. Since you’re not logged in, I’ll need an email for alert notifications.”

The assistant would call the add_host function for effective monitoring:

{
  "name": "add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "mycompany.com",
    "endpoint": "http",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}

This action registers the host with regular monitoring, meaning the assistant will periodically check your server’s availability and performance.

A Critical Alert: Detection in Action

A little later, the assistant detects repeated failures connecting via HTTP.

Assistant: “An alert just triggered! mycompany.com is reporting repeated timeouts—your site appears to be down. Let’s review the incident details.”

The assistant queries recent monitoring data:

{
  "name": "get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "mycompany.com"
  }
}

This returns error logs, timestamps, response codes, and verifies the server is truly unresponsive—not just experiencing a brief hiccup.

Root Cause Investigation: Pinpointing the Failure

User: “Can you help identify what might be causing the outage?”

Assistant: “Absolutely. I’ll check for network issues first using an ICMP (ping) test, and then see if DNS lookups are resolving correctly. This helps distinguish between server, network, or DNS problems.”

Parallel function calls are launched:

{
  "name": "multi_tool_use.parallel",
  "arguments": {
    "tool_uses": [
      {
        "recipient_name": "functions.add_host",
        "parameters": {
          "detail_response": true,
          "address": "mycompany.com",
          "endpoint": "icmp",
          "email": "user@example.com"
        }
      },
      {
        "recipient_name": "functions.add_host",
        "parameters": {
          "detail_response": true,
          "address": "mycompany.com",
          "endpoint": "dns",
          "email": "user@example.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Results might reveal, for example, that ICMP pings are failing but DNS resolution is fine, indicating a network or server problem rather than a domain configuration error.

Actionable Insights and Remediation

Assistant: “The server isn’t responding to ping requests, but DNS records are normal. This suggests the server is offline or the hosting provider is unreachable.”

Suggestions for next steps could be:

- “Check your hosting provider’s status page for widespread issues.”
- “If you have SSH or remote access, try restarting the server or web services.”
- “Would you like an automated SSL check to see if certificate issues might block HTTP requests?”

If the user agrees, the assistant proceeds:

{
  "name": "add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "mycompany.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}

The response might clarify if the SSL layer was part of the problem or not.

Issue Resolved: Confirmation and Final Checks

User: “I rebooted the server as suggested. Can you verify if everything’s back up?”

Assistant: “Let’s run checks again!”

{
  "name": "get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "mycompany.com"
  }
}

All indicators now show normal, with healthy response times—success!
