1. Bandwidth Utilization: This metric measures the amount of data being transmitted across the network at any given time. High bandwidth utilization can cause network congestion and reduce network performance, leading to slow response times and a poor user experience.

2. Latency: Latency measures the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another on the network. High latency can cause delays in data transmission, leading to slow response times and an overall reduction in network performance.

3. Packet Loss: Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their intended destination. High packet loss can indicate network congestion or other issues that may be impacting network performance and security.

4. Network Security Threats: Monitoring for network security threats is essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of your network. Key metrics to monitor include the number and type of security incidents, the severity of those incidents, and the effectiveness of your security measures in detecting and preventing them.

5. User Experience: Monitoring user experience metrics such as application response times, network availability, and overall network performance can provide valuable insights into the health of your network and help you identify areas for improvement.
