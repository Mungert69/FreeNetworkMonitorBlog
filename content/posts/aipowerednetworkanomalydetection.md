In today’s fast-evolving cyber landscape, identifying zero-day threats before they cause harm is a critical challenge for every IT professional. Zero-day threats exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities and effortlessly slip past signature-based detection systems. This is where the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) shines: harnessing AI-powered behavioral analysis to detect anomalies—often the first signs of these stealthy attacks—before they escalate.

Let’s walk through a step-by-step example of how you can leverage the Assistant for AI-powered anomaly detection on your network, focusing on zero-day threat identification.

---

User: I want to identify suspicious activity on our web server that could be a zero-day threat. Where should I start?

Assistant: Great goal! The first step is to add your web server to be continuously monitored. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) can track metrics like availability, response times, protocol compliance, and more—feeding this data into its AI engine for behavioral analysis.

Let’s add your server for monitoring. Suppose your web server is hosted at example.com.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "port": 443,
    "timeout": 60000,
    "email": "your.email@domain.com"
  }
}
```
We used add_host with the HTTPS endpoint to set up real-time monitoring of your web server, specifying your email for alerts.

---

User: Monitoring is set up—how can I see if there are unusual patterns or possible anomalies?

Assistant: Now that the web server is being monitored, let’s fetch the recent behavioral data for it and use the AI’s analysis engine to flag any anomalies. The get_host_data function lets us retrieve detailed monitoring statistics.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```
This call fetches the latest data—think of it as a real-time pulse on your web server's health, traffic, response times, and connection anomalies.

With this dataset, the Quantum Network Monitor AI compares current behavior to historical baselines, detecting deviations that might indicate zero-day exploits—such as unexpected traffic spikes, communication with suspicious endpoints, or unusual sequence of protocol commands.

---

User: Suppose the AI highlights an anomaly. How can I investigate further?

Assistant: Excellent! Suppose the system flags a traffic anomaly on port 443. Let's say it noticed a sustained increase in response times and some failed SSL handshakes. You might want to examine the detailed history during the anomaly window.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "example.com",
    "date_start": "2025-07-10T15:00:00",
    "date_end": "2025-07-10T17:00:00"
  }
}
```
This will extract all behavioral logs between 3pm and 5pm—letting you drill down into what happened when the anomaly was spotted.

At this point, the Assistant helps you interpret traffic spikes, failed requests, strange agent locations, or shifts in protocol activity—clues that may point to zero-day exploitation attempts.

---

User: I need to correlate this anomaly with global threat patterns. Can the Assistant help?

Assistant: Absolutely! One advanced feature is to integrate local anomaly data with quantum and AI-based global threat intelligence. If you spot a suspicious traffic pattern, the Assistant can trigger a security expert scan or escalate to a quantum security review, giving you context about whether others have seen something similar.

For example, you might request a vulnerability scan:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Scan example.com for active zero-day exploitation patterns, including protocol anomalies detected at 2025-07-10T16:00. Correlate with global threat feeds. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```
This brings in real-time threat intelligence, matching your anomaly with emerging global exploits, and providing remediation guidance instantly.
