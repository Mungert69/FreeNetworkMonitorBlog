In today's fast-paced world, websites are the backbone of businesses. They serve as a tool to communicate with customers, generate leads, and establish an online presence. In this regard, it is essential that websites operate at optimum levels.

For businesses relying on their website to be up and running all the time, website monitoring is crucial in ensuring maximum uptime and accessibility. It involves tracking website activity round-the-clock using network monitoring tools that provide insights into the performance of different elements within your infrastructure.

Here are some best practices for website monitoring:

1. Regularly check server response time – Server response time determines how quickly your server responds after receiving a request from the browser. This metric affects website speed and load times which can significantly impact user experience and SEO rankings.

2. Monitor web page performance – It's not enough just to check if your site is 'up.' Website owners need to know what aspects of their site may be causing slow load times or poor user experiences so they can address issues before they become problems.

3. Keep track of bandwidth usage – Bandwidth usage measures how much data transmits over a network connection; you don't want visitors waiting too long while pages slowly upload because you've exceeded your allowed limit

4. Measure Uptime - Downtime usually means lost opportunities when it comes to sales or lead generation since there won’t be any new visitors browsing through products or services offered by the site during downtime periods

5. Identify potential security threats - Security Intrusion Detection (IDS) Network Monitoring Tools will keep watch 24/7 alerting users about malicious activities detected on their servers, thereby preventing possible hacks & Malware intrusions on clients’ systems 

By adopting these best practices for website monitoring with network-monitoring solutions , organizations can ensure continuous availability of vital resources by proactively addressing issues before they occur without IT staff being overwhelmed with manual workload tasks allowing them more free-time instead completing workloads autonomously.
