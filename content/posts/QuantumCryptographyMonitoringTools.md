As organizations adopt quantum encryption as a new security standard, network monitoring practices must evolve to address emerging metrics and potential threats unique to this field. In this blog post, we’ll walk through how a user can leverage the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) to monitor quantum-encrypted systems and track the most relevant and impactful metrics.

Let’s step through a realistic conversation between a user and the Assistant, highlighting how the new metrics and quantum-focused endpoints can be configured and tracked in your network environment.

User: I want to start monitoring the quantum encryption status for my main gateway, quantum.example.com. How do I set up quantum-specific monitoring?

Assistant: Great! To get started, we’ll create a monitoring entry for your quantum-secured gateway. We’ll use the "quantum" endpoint which is designed for quantum-safe encryption checks, allowing us to track metrics that are specifically relevant to post-quantum security (like cryptographic handshake health, key exchange latency, and alert flags for outdated or non-quantum ciphers).

Let me add your gateway as a host to monitor with quantum-specific settings:

```json
{
  "detail_response": true,
  "address": "quantum.example.com",
  "endpoint": "quantum",
  "timeout": 60000,
  "email": "your@email.com"
}
```

We use add_host to set up ongoing quantum encryption status checks. Once added, you’ll receive alerts if the cryptographic protocols deviate from quantum-safe standards or if response times suggest handshake instability.

User: What new metrics does the assistant track for quantum endpoints?

Assistant: For quantum-enabled endpoints, the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) tracks important metrics such as:

- Quantum cryptographic handshake time: Latency measurements of quantum key negotiations.
- Cipher suite compliance: Verifying that only quantum-safe ciphers are in use.
- Protocol health and fallback detection: Ensuring there’s no downgrade to legacy encryption.
- Alert flags: Immediate warnings if a non-quantum cryptography method is detected.
- Agent location: Checking from which monitoring point the quantum handshake is validated.

Let’s see the latest metrics for your gateway.

```json
{
  "detail_response": true,
  "dataset_id": 0,
  "address": "quantum.example.com"
}
```

Here, get_host_data retrieves the real-time health and compliance of your quantum encryption implementation, including the specific cryptography details and handshake performance.

User: Can I check historical quantum encryption events, like when a cipher fallback occurred?

Assistant: Absolutely. We can pull historical monitoring data to see every event—especially any fallback or protocol anomaly—over a given period.

```json
{
  "detail_response": true,
  "address": "quantum.example.com",
  "date_start": "2025-07-20T00:00:00",
  "date_end": "2025-07-27T00:00:00"
}
```

Using get_host_data with custom date ranges, you can audit all quantum status events, verify compliance, and ensure your cryptographic posture has been robust over time.

---

User: What if my quantum encryption setup changes, or I want to increase the timeout for handshake testing?

Assistant: That’s easy to update! You can edit your monitoring configuration any time.

Let’s say you want to increase the quantum handshake timeout to 90 seconds:

```json
{
  "detail_response": true,
  "address": "quantum.example.com",
  "timeout": 90000
}
```

The edit_host function dynamically updates your monitoring profile to reflect the new timeout or any other parameter changes, ensuring your quantum cryptography monitoring adapts to new policies.

In summary, the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) makes it straightforward to adopt advanced monitoring for quantum-encrypted infrastructure. Key quantum-specific metrics—like handshake time, protocol compliance, and alerting for non-quantum ciphers—are now first-class citizens in your security operations. As the quantum era arrives, keeping your monitoring toolkit up to date is essential. Start tracking quantum metrics today and ensure your network stays ahead of tomorrow’s threats!
