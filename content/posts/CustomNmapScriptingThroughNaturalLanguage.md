Curious about harnessing the power of custom Nmap scripts—without having to write a single line of code? With the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), you can create advanced network scans simply by describing your goals in natural language. Here’s how you can collaborate with the assistant to tailor-make Nmap scans for your unique needs.

Let’s walk through a practical example: Suppose you want to conduct a detailed scan of your server, targeting open web ports and using specific Nmap scripts for vulnerability detection. Here’s how the entire process might unfold:

Step 1: State Your Scanning Intent

User:  
I need to scan my server example.com for all open web ports, and I want to check for common vulnerabilities using Nmap. Can you help me set this up?

Assistant:  
Absolutely! To customize an advanced Nmap scan, could you tell me:
- Should we scan all TCP ports, or focus on standard web ports like 80, 443, and 8080?
- Any specific vulnerabilities or script categories you want Nmap to run (e.g., http-vuln*, ssl*)?
- Would you like the scan to run from a specific network location?

Step 2: Provide Requirements in Natural Language

User:  
Just scan standard web ports (80, 443, 8080), and use http-vuln* scripts. Run from a remote agent in the EU, please.

Step 3: The Assistant Translates to an Nmap Script Request

The assistant crafts a request for the Security Expert, including all technical Nmap details. Here’s how it looks “under the hood”:
```json


{
  "name": "call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Please perform an Nmap scan on example.com, focusing on ports 80, 443, and 8080. Apply all script categories matching 'http-vuln*' to detect common web vulnerabilities. Ensure the scan is comprehensive but safe. The user has authorized this request.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```

The assistant will now wait for the Security Expert’s response and present you with the results—without you ever having to type out a complex Nmap command. You'll see specifics about open ports, any flagged vulnerabilities, and even suggestions for remediation.

Step 4: Review Results and Refine

User:  
Great, can we also test all SSL/TLS ciphers on port 443 for weaknesses?

Assistant:  
Of course! I’ll update the scan instructions to include SSL cipher checks on port 443 using appropriate Nmap scripts (like ssl-enum-ciphers):
```json


{
  "name": "call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Additionally, run the Nmap script 'ssl-enum-ciphers' against example.com on port 443 to enumerate all supported SSL/TLS ciphers and identify any weak configurations. This is authorized by the user.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```

Again, results are parsed for you, so you get actionable insight instead of raw Nmap outputs.

Step 5: Iterate All in Natural Language

At any time, you can further refine the scan: add more ports, run specific vulnerability checks, or compare past results. No scripting or command-line skills required—the assistant translates your requests into expert Nmap syntax and configuration behind the scenes.

To sum up, [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) empowers you to run highly customized Nmap scans just by explaining what you want checked. The assistant bridges the gap between natural language and technical scripting, making advanced network scanning accessible to everyone.

Try it for yourself: Describe your scanning challenge to the assistant, and let it tailor an Nmap solution for you—no scripting knowledge needed!
