In today's world, where we are surrounded by technology and rely heavily on the internet, keeping our data secure is more important than ever. With the rise of quantum computing in recent years, network security has become a pressing concern for organizations worldwide. It's no longer sufficient to just use traditional encryption techniques; businesses must now prepare themselves for an era when current encryption standards won't be enough to protect their sensitive information from being compromised.

So how can you ensure your network is secure and ready for future threats? Below are ten best practices that will help maintain both network security and quantum readiness.

1. Keep up with software updates
The first step towards ensuring network security is making sure that all software used within your organization, including operating systems, applications, and third-party components such as plugins or libraries are regularly updated with the latest patches available. This helps prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers looking to exploit known weaknesses in order to gain access to sensitive data.

2. Use Strong Passwords
One common issue found across many organizations is weak passwords which can easily be broken using brute-force attacks or other methods since they lack complexity or randomness - this makes them vulnerable targets for cybercriminals seeking unauthorized access into private networks or accounts. To combat this problem always enforce strong password policies amongst employees who should use complex combinations of numbers/symbols/letters (uppercase/lowercase) at least 8 characters long.


3. Implement Two-Factor Authentication 
Two-factor authentication involves requiring users not only enter login credentials but also verify their identity through another means like a code sent via a text message or voice call – adding an extra layer of protection beyond just usernames/passwords alone which greatly increases overall account safety.


4. Encrypt Data End-to-End
Encryption protects communications between endpoints so even if intercepted along the way during transmission– hackers can't understand what it says without decrypting using specific keys- making them worthless! Investing in end-to-end encryption for communications with vendors, customers or partners should be a top priority.

5. Use Firewalls & VPNs 
Firewalls are key components of network security infrastructure that prevent unauthorized access to your network by blocking traffic from foreign sources; while Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow remote employees or contractors secure access via an encrypted connection- thus ensuring data stays safe over the internet.

6. Regularly Back-up Data
In case of unexpected disasters like ransomware attacks, natural disasters etc., regularly backing up your data ensures critical business operations can resume as quickly as possible since data can easily be restored – reducing any long-term impact on productivity in addition to protecting valuable information assets against loss or corruption.

7. Invest in Security Tools
Investing in reliable and up-to-date antivirus software is crucial but making use of other endpoint protection tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS) which work together alongside firewalls provide additional layers of defense against malware threats and hacking attempts.


8. Train Staff on Cybersecurity Awareness 
Building a company culture whereby security awareness amongst staff is normalized through regular training programs helps reduce risk brought about by human error resulting from clicking dangerous links/emails among others- providing a vital safeguard when securing organizational networks.


9. Apply Zero Trust 
The zero-trust model involves assuming no trust for any user on your network until their identity has been authenticated using multiple factors before granting them access rights.. This approach reduces the chancesof hackers infiltrating networks undetected whilst allowing you monitor activity internally too!

10. Bring Experts On-board 
Sometimes it's just best to leave things to professionals who specialize solely in cybersecurity solutions! Outsourcing cyber-service providers brings fresh perspectives on existing issues, schemes often lead to improved results with fewer vulnerabilities deterred faster than ever – cutting costs both short-term and long term planning goals into account alike!


Conclusion:
With quantum computers being developed around the world at an exponential rate, organizations are in a race against time to ensure their networks' security. Implementing the above ten best practices is one way for companies to prepare themselves for a future where traditional encryption methods no longer provide adequate protection of sensitive data. By being proactive and continuously reviewing and updating your network security policies as technology advances, you can stay ahead of potential threats and keep your organization's information safe from cyber criminals.
