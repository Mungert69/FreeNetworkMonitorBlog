1. Regularly update software and firmware – Keeping your network infrastructure up to date with the latest software and firmware patches will ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed and security is maintained.

2. Implement strong password policies – Use strong and unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication for added security.

3. Conduct regular security audits – Regular security audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities and allow you to take action to address them before they are exploited.

4. Use encryption – Encrypting data both in transit and at rest can help protect sensitive information from being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized users.

5. Implement network segmentation – Network segmentation can help mitigate the impact of a security breach by limiting the attacker's ability to move laterally across the network.

6. Train employees on security best practices – Education and awareness are critical to maintaining network security. Employees should be trained on how to identify and respond to potential security threats.

7. Monitor network activity – Monitor network activity for unusual or suspicious behavior and investigate any anomalies immediately.

8. Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems – Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems can help detect and prevent network attacks.

9. Conduct regular backups – Regular backups can help ensure that critical data is not lost in the event of a security breach or system failure.

10. Prepare for quantum computing – Quantum computing is a potential threat to network security. Organizations should begin preparing for quantum computing by implementing quantum-safe encryption protocols and ensuring that their systems are quantum resilient.
