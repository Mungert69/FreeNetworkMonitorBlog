## Use Case 1: Adding and Monitoring Hosts

One of the first steps in network monitoring is adding hosts that you want to keep an eye on. The Network Monitor Assistant makes this process simple and efficient.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Add a new host with the address example.com using HTTP monitoring."
- **Assistant:** "Host example.com has been added and is now being monitored via HTTP."

Once you've added a host, you can easily check its status and performance metrics.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Show me the latest data for the host example.com."
- **Assistant:** "Here is the latest monitoring data for example.com: Response time 120ms, status: active."

This allows you to quickly assess the health of your network resources.

## Use Case 2: Editing Host Configurations

As your network evolves, you may need to adjust the monitoring configurations for your hosts. The assistant allows you to edit these settings effortlessly.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Update the timeout for example.com to 30 seconds."
- **Assistant:** "The timeout for example.com has been updated to 30 seconds."

This flexibility ensures that your monitoring setup can adapt to changing network conditions.

## Use Case 3: Conducting Security Assessments

In addition to basic monitoring, the Network Monitor Assistant can help you perform security assessments to identify vulnerabilities in your network.

### Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Can you scan the domain example.com for vulnerabilities?"
- **Assistant:** "Running a vulnerability scan on example.com. Please wait..."
- **Assistant:** "Scan complete: No critical vulnerabilities found."

This feature is essential for maintaining the integrity of your network and ensuring that potential threats are addressed promptly.

### Additional Example Interaction:
- **User:** "Scan my network 192.168.0.0/24 for open ports."
- **Assistant:** "Running an Nmap scan on the network 192.168.0.0/24. Please wait..."
- **Assistant:** "Scan complete: Found open ports on 3 devices."

By utilizing these advanced scanning capabilities, you can gain deeper insights into your network's security posture.
