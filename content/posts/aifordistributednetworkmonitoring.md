questions:
  - "What is the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant (QNMA) used for?"
  - "How do I set up monitoring for hosts in different geographic locations using QNMA?"
  - "Can QNMA provide real-time performance data such as latency and uptime for monitored hosts?"
  - "Is it possible to add a new monitoring agent in a location where I open a new branch, such as Singapore?"
  - "Do I need to provide an email address when setting up hosts for monitoring in QNMA?"
answers:
  - "QNMA is an AI-powered tool designed to monitor geographically dispersed network infrastructure, providing real-time insights, uptime, latency, and security monitoring across multiple regions."
  - "First, list available network agents in the desired regions using the get_agents function. Then, add hosts to be monitored by specifying their address, monitoring endpoint (like HTTPS or ICMP), and the agent location corresponding to each region using the add_host function."
  - "Yes, by using the get_host_data function, QNMA retrieves real-time details including response time, downtime history, and alert status for each monitored host, contextualized by the agent location."
  - "Absolutely. You can install a QNMA agent in the new location and then add it as an agent in the system. After that, you can register hosts to be monitored from that new agent just like in other regions."
  - "Yes, if you are not logged in, you need to provide your email address when adding hosts so that you can receive alerts related to the monitored hosts."

In today’s interconnected world, organizations are rarely constrained by geography. Their digital assets span clouds, data centers, branch offices, and remote worksites—making network health, uptime, and security a distributed challenge. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) (QNMA) is designed to bring AI-powered clarity and effortless automation to monitoring such geographically dispersed infrastructure. In this blog, we’ll walk through, step-by-step, how you can use QNMA to monitor hosts around the globe, select the right network agent for each region, and get actionable insights in real time.

Let’s explore a typical workflow with QNMA for distributed network monitoring.

User: I have offices in New York, London, and Tokyo. I want to monitor key hosts from each physical location to detect regional issues. How do I set this up?

Assistant: Great goal! QNMA allows you to deploy or select network agents in various regions, then assign hosts for monitoring at each site. Let’s start by listing available agents—which are essentially the monitoring points you can use.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

We’re querying all agent locations, which may include internet-based and location-specific agents. Once you see agents representing New York, London, and Tokyo, you can assign monitors accordingly.

Assistant: Here are your agents—let’s proceed to add sample hosts for each region.

User: For New York, I want to monitor nyc-server.company.com via HTTPS, for London monitor lon-db.company.com with an ICMP (Ping), and for Tokyo check the public website www.company.jp using the 'http' endpoint.

Assistant: Perfect! I’ll set these up. For each, we’ll specify the host, monitoring method, and agent location. Since you’re not logged in, please provide your email to receive alerts.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "nyc-server.company.com",
    "endpoint": "https",
    "agent_location": "New York - US",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "lon-db.company.com",
    "endpoint": "icmp",
    "agent_location": "London - UK",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "www.company.jp",
    "endpoint": "http",
    "agent_location": "Tokyo - JP",
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }
}
```

By calling add_host with the agent_location parameter, we’re instructing QNMA to monitor each system from the corresponding region. This allows you to distinguish network or service issues that may be site-specific (for example, Tokyo’s site loads fine from the US but is slow when monitored from within Japan? Now you’ll know!).

Assistant: Hosts are now monitored from their assigned agents! Want to review performance or check for downtime or regional latency?

User: Yes! Show me latency and uptime stats for all three, please.

Assistant: I’ll pull the latest monitoring data for each one.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "nyc-server.company.com",
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "lon-db.company.com",
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "www.company.jp",
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

This get_host_data function retrieves real-time details—such as response time, downtime history, and alert status—for each monitored host, contextualized by the agent location. With this, you can quickly visualize if any office is experiencing unique latency spikes or connectivity problems.

User: If we open a new branch in Singapore, can I add a local agent there?

Assistant: Absolutely! Simply install a QNMA agent in Singapore and repeat the above steps—add it as an agent, then register new or existing hosts to be checked from there as well.
