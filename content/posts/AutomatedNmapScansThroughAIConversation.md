Curious if you can run a full port scan on your own network without memorizing Nmap flags or laboriously configuring scripts? With the Free Network Monitor Assistant, complex network scans—like probing for open ports—are handled seamlessly through natural language conversation. Here’s a step-by-step look at how you can use the assistant to automate Nmap scans, illustrated with a realistic interaction.

Let’s walk through a typical use case: you want to scan your home or office network to identify which ports are open, helping you detect unknown vulnerabilities or unauthorized services.

Getting Started: Natural Language Simplicity

User:  
Scan my network for open ports.

The assistant interprets your request and knows you’re asking for an Nmap port scan—the industry-standard tool for network reconnaissance. Rather than expecting you to supply technical arguments, the assistant initiates the scan setup.

Assistant:  
Sure! Could you specify which device, IP range, or hostname you’d like to scan? Also, do you want the scan conducted from a local network agent, or is an internet-based scan sufficient?

User:  
Let’s scan 192.168.1.0/24 from my local agent.

Behind the Scenes: Selecting the Right Agent

The assistant now determines where the scan should run (your local agent is ideal for internal network sweeps) and prepares the Nmap parameters accordingly.

Assistant:  
Got it! I’ll start an Nmap scan of 192.168.1.0/24 from your local agent to check for open TCP ports. This may take a few minutes. Would you like a standard scan or a more detailed service/version detection?

User:  
Just a standard scan is fine.

Running the Nmap Scan (Function Call Demo)

Now, the assistant communicates your request to a network security expert LLM that handles the underlying Nmap execution:

{
  "name": "call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Perform a standard Nmap scan for open TCP ports on 192.168.1.0/24. No service/version detection required. The user confirmed authorization for this action.",
    "agent_location": "Local Agent Name"
  }
}

Processing the Results

Once the scan is finished, the assistant gathers the output and summarizes the findings:

Assistant:  
The Nmap scan is complete! Here are the highlights:

- 192.168.1.2: open ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)
- 192.168.1.5: open port 443 (HTTPS)
- 192.168.1.20: open port 3389 (RDP)

Let me know if you’d like details for a specific IP or want to further investigate any services.

Making Adjustments or Follow-Up Scans

User:  
Let’s run a version scan just on 192.168.1.5.

The assistant can easily update its query and rerun the Nmap command:

{
  "name": "call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Perform a targeted Nmap scan on 192.168.1.5 with service/version detection enabled. The user confirmed authorization for this action.",
    "agent_location": "Local Agent Name"
  }
}

The assistant then shares the results—perhaps revealing the web server software and potential vulnerabilities.

Summary: AI-Powered Nmap Scanning, No Command Line Needed

Throughout this exchange, the Free Network Monitor Assistant simplifies what would otherwise involve complex commands or specialized knowledge. The key function at play—call_security_expert—translates your intent into the appropriate Nmap operation, runs it via your chosen agent, and delivers easy-to-understand results. You can iterate, focus or expand the scope of your scans, and get actionable insights—all through plain English.
