Designing secure network zones (network segmentation) is a crucial part of any robust cybersecurity strategy. In this blog, we’ll show how the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) can guide you step-by-step—from conceptualizing your segmentation plan, to actively monitoring each segment for performance and security. Let’s walk through how a user can harness the assistant’s power to design, implement, and maintain secure zones in their organization.

User: I want to segment my internal network into secure zones: one for user devices, one for servers, and one for IoT devices. Can you help?

Assistant: Absolutely! Let’s start by defining each zone’s boundaries. I’ll guide you in labeling and grouping key assets. Next, we’ll deploy monitors on critical endpoints within each segment to ensure everything remains secure and visible.

User: Start by showing me all active hosts so I can assign them to the right zones.

Assistant:
Let’s get you a list of all currently monitored hosts, including their addresses and endpoints.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```
This function call retrieves the complete configuration of all monitored hosts, so you can see what’s already under watch.

Suppose the output shows your file server (“srv-files”), a few laptops, an IP camera, and a database server.

User: Assign the file server and database server to a “Server Zone”. The laptops go into a “User Devices Zone”, and the camera into an “IoT Zone”. Can we monitor each segment with different rules?

Assistant: Yes! We’ll set up specialized monitoring for each zone, customizing protocols and alert thresholds. For example:
- Server Zone: Deep monitoring (HTTP, port checks, certificate validation, quantum security tests)
- User Devices: Lightweight (ICMP ping, minimal port checks)
- IoT Zone: Strict (basic connectivity, anomaly alerts, quick response if a device is unexpectedly online/offline)

Let’s enable and configure these checks:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "id": 101,
    "detail_response": true,
    "endpoint": "https",
    "agent_location": "Server Zone Monitor",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```
Here, we’re updating the file server (host id 101) to be part of the Server Zone, monitoring it over HTTPS, and associating it with a dedicated agent.

User: What about quantum security for the servers?

Assistant: Great thinking. Let’s run a quantum vulnerability scan specifically on your Server Zone assets.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_quantum_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Assess quantum cryptographic strength for srv-files and db-sql over standard ports.",
    "agent_location": "Server Zone Monitor"
  }
}
```
This request ensures you’re not just segmented, but also equipped to resist next-gen cyber threats.

User: How can I view historical alerts and performance for each zone?

Assistant: I’ll filter monitoring data and alert activity by zone (as defined by agent location or group label):

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "agent_location": "User Devices Zone",
    "alert_flag": true
  }
}
```
This call fetches a detailed log of alerts and performance for devices in the user segment.
