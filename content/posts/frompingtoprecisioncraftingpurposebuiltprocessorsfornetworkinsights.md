In this blog, we’ll walk you through how the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) can elevate your monitoring and security with custom, precision command processors—tools that turn routine network checks like pings into sophisticated workflows tailored for unique insights.

Let’s imagine a user—Alex—wants to go beyond simple pings and create a specialized command processor that runs a sequence of diagnostic steps: ping a device, check DNS, and then pull interface stats, all in one go for their branch office.

Step 1: Discovering Existing Command Processors

Alex begins by asking:

User: Can you show me what command processors are already available on my “Branch-Office-Agent”?

Assistant: Great idea! Let’s list all custom command processors to see what’s set up.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "list available cmd processors. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Branch-Office-Agent"
  }
}
```

After running this, the assistant returns a list—perhaps “QuickPing”, “DNSCheck”, and “FullDiag”. Alex sees there’s nothing combining all checks as a single workflow.

Step 2: Creating a Purpose-Built Command Processor

User: I want to create a command processor that pings a host, checks DNS resolution, and runs “ifconfig” for interface details—call it “TripleNetDiag”.

Assistant: Perfect! I’ll create “TripleNetDiag” to issue ping, nslookup, and ifconfig together.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Create a new cmd processor named 'TripleNetDiag' for Branch-Office-Agent. It should: 1) ping the input host, 2) run nslookup on the host, 3) execute 'ifconfig'. Confirm that I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Branch-Office-Agent"
  }
}
```

The assistant interprets and relays the request—no coding expertise needed!

Step 3: Running Your Precision Processor

User: Let’s run “TripleNetDiag” against 10.0.10.20.

Assistant: Launching now. Here’s how I’d invoke the command processor:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Run the cmd processor 'TripleNetDiag' with argument '10.0.10.20'. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Branch-Office-Agent"
  }
}
```

Soon, Alex gets a result combining ping results, DNS lookup, and interface status—a complete network snapshot in one click.

Step 4: Fine-tuning and Reviewing Source Code

User: I’d like to add traceroute. Can you update “TripleNetDiag” to include that?

Assistant: Absolutely! Let’s modify the command processor:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Update 'TripleNetDiag' to also perform a traceroute on the input host after the previous steps. Confirm that I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Branch-Office-Agent"
  }
}
```

Step 5: Auditing or Sharing the Source

User: Can I see the script source or share it?

Assistant: Yes, you can always view or retrieve the processor code for review and collaboration!

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Show the source code for cmd processor 'TripleNetDiag'. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Branch-Office-Agent"
  }
}
```

This allows Alex to audit, tweak, or share the diagnostic workflow with teammates.
