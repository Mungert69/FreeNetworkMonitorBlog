In today’s fast-paced IT environments, keeping up with compliance requirements can be an uphill battle—especially when it comes to generating consistent, audit-ready reports about your network’s health and security posture. Thankfully, the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) makes this process seamless. In this blog post, we’ll walk through just how easy it is to automate network compliance reporting using straightforward queries and built-in monitoring functions. 

Let’s imagine Sarah, a network administrator, wants to generate a comprehensive compliance report showing all currently monitored hosts, their endpoint types, alert statuses, and availability—all details that auditors commonly request.

Step 1: Initiating the Query

Sarah starts by telling the Assistant:
User: Can you show me all currently monitored hosts and their status?

Here, the Assistant leverages the get_host_list function, which is designed to pull a filtered or complete list of all hosts under surveillance, along with their configurations and current status. Since an audit-ready report usually needs maximum detail, the Assistant sets detail_response to true:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

After processing, the Assistant displays a neatly formatted overview of each host, including essential fields like address, endpoint, enabled status, and agent location.

Step 2: Drilling Down for Alert Status

Sarah wants to include information about any hosts that have generated alerts in the last compliance period. She asks:
User: Which hosts currently have an active alert flag?

The Assistant uses the get_host_data function with alert_flag set to true, providing a filtered, audit-focused dataset that highlights compliance issues:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "alert_flag": true,
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

The response lists only the hosts with active alerts, giving Sarah immediate insight into potential compliance gaps or ongoing incidents—critical information for any network audit.

Step 3: Generating Historical Compliance Trends

To show auditors diligence over time, Sarah requests outage and alert trends for a specific period:
User: Can you give me a history of alerts for server-1.company.com from June 1 to June 30?

The Assistant creates a targeted query, requesting historical data for that host and date range:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "address": "server-1.company.com",
    "date_start": "2024-06-01T00:00:00",
    "date_end": "2024-06-30T23:59:59"
  }
}
```

This produces a time-stamped log of incidents, which Sarah can export or include as a compliance appendix.

Step 4: Exporting the Data

Once satisfied, Sarah asks:
User: Can I receive this as a downloadable report for my audit records?

While the core assistant doesn’t create files directly, it guides her on how to copy the data into Excel or other tools for archiving, ensuring the format is audit-friendly and ready for review.

A Smooth Compliance Workflow

Throughout this process, Sarah needed only simple, natural language queries to obtain comprehensive, audit-grade compliance data. Each function call—get_host_list to enumerate assets, get_host_data to focus on alerts and history—demonstrates the power of automating compliance reporting without sifting through manual logs or data dumps.
