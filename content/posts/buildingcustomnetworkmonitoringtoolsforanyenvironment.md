In this guide, we walk through how the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) empowers users to create truly custom network monitoring solutions for any environment—whether you're watching IoT devices at home, managing enterprise infrastructure, or monitoring a hybrid cloud. We'll focus on leveraging the power of custom command processors, including two hands-on examples: the classic PingProcessor and a user-defined TextValidatorProcessor.

Let’s see how a typical interaction unfolds:

---

The user, wanting to monitor a new device, starts by chatting with the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open).

User: I need a custom network check that pings a device and reports if it’s unreachable. Can I make a monitoring tool for that?

Assistant: Absolutely! You can build a "PingProcessor"—a command processor that regularly pings your device and triggers alerts when it doesn't respond.

To help you get started, I’ll ask the Cmd Processor Expert to create a PingProcessor on your preferred monitoring agent.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Create a new command processor called PingProcessor that accepts a target IP address as argument, performs ICMP ping, and reports if host is up or down. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "default"
  }
}
```

After the request is made, the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) communicates with the Cmd Processor Expert. This expert securely deploys the PingProcessor on your chosen agent—no coding skills required! You can now schedule this processor to monitor any device you wish.

User: How do I run the PingProcessor to watch 10.10.1.5 every 60 seconds?

Assistant: I’ll schedule it to ping 10.10.1.5 every minute and report the status.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Run PingProcessor on the agent with argument '10.10.1.5' on a 60 second schedule. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "default"
  }
}
```

Now, the PingProcessor pings the device, and you’ll see timely alerts if it ever goes down.

But command processors aren’t just for connectivity. Suppose you want to verify the presence of a specific keyword in a web page’s response—a use case that’s perfect for a TextValidatorProcessor.

User: I want to create a TextValidatorProcessor that fetches a web page and confirms the words ‘System Operational’ are present.

Assistant: Great idea! I’ll guide the Cmd Processor Expert to set up this validator.

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Create a new command processor called TextValidatorProcessor. It should download content from a given URL, search for 'System Operational', and alert if not found. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "default"
  }
}
```

Once the command processor is ready, it can be run or scheduled like other monitors—for example, to check a status dashboard every five minutes.

User: What if I want to see (or modify) the TextValidatorProcessor’s source code later?

Assistant: You’re fully supported! You can request the source at any time:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Show me the source code of TextValidatorProcessor. I am authorized.",
    "agent_location": "default"
  }
}
```

and you can give edits as new requests, allowing you to iterate on your monitoring logic—no need to be a .NET expert!

In summary: The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) allows you to custom-tailor monitoring for any environment. Using command processors, you’re not limited to canned checks. Whether it’s PingProcessor, TextValidatorProcessor, or a new idea altogether, just describe what you need in plain language and the assistant takes care of the technical heavy lifting—from creation and scheduling to viewing and updating your processors.
