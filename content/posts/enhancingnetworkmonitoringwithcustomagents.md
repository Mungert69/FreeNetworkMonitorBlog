questions:
  - "How do I pick the right agent for on-site diagnostics?"
  - "How do I install BusyBox and wget on the branch agent?"
  - "How can I verify the tools are working on the agent?"
  - "How do I bind monitors to the branch agent and receive alerts?"
  - "What should I do when an alert fires or results look off?"
answers:
  - "Use get_agents to list available agents and select the one closest to your target LAN (e.g., “Branch Office - Linux”). This ensures low-latency, inside-the-LAN measurements without WAN noise."
  - "Ask the Cmd Processor Expert to list existing processors. If none fit, create a new processor named PkgOps that can safely run package installs (apt/yum/apk), then run: PkgOps install busybox wget. The processor returns exit code, stdout, and stderr and is idempotent (reports already the newest version if present)."
  - "Run BusyBox commands for local checks: ip -br addr to confirm interfaces and addresses, and ping -c 4 <gateway IP> to measure packet loss and latency from inside the branch. For HTTP, run wget --spider -T 3 -t 1 http://intranet.local/healthz via PkgOps to validate DNS, routing, and service reachability."
  - "Create monitors with add_host and set agent_location to “Branch Office - Linux.” Example: ICMP for 192.168.10.1 and HTTP for intranet.local:80. Include an email to receive alerts. Use get_host_data to view current status, response time, agent location, and recent timestamps."
  - "Run deeper on-box diagnostics: traceroute intranet.local to find latency hops, arp -a to spot duplicate or stale entries, and DNS lookups from the branch to validate split-horizon behavior. Keep BusyBox usage limited to trusted internal targets."

In this walkthrough, we’ll show how a network engineer used the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant to deploy a custom agent at a branch office and enhance monitoring with on-box tools like BusyBox and wget. The goal: reduce troubleshooting time, monitor internal services behind firewalls, and run low-latency diagnostics right where the issues occur.

Why custom agents help
- Reach internal assets: Monitor and troubleshoot services not exposed to the internet (intranets, printers, ERP, IoT).
- Lower latency: Measure performance from inside the site for accurate user-experience telemetry.
- Extend your toolkit: Add BusyBox for networking commands and wget for HTTP checks, scripted health probes, and content verifications.
- Autonomy and resilience: Keep investigating even when WAN links are flaky.

Step 1 — Find or deploy the right agent
User: “List available agents—I want to use the branch office Linux box for local checks.”

Assistant: “I’ll fetch agents so you can pick the best one for on-site diagnostics.”

We use get_agents to discover available agents and select the one that lives closest to our target network.

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": { "detail_response": false }
}
```

Interpreting the response
Assume the assistant receives entries like:
- Scanner - EU
- Scanner - US-East
- Branch Office - Linux (local)
We’ll pick “Branch Office - Linux” for internal monitoring and diagnostics.

Step 2 — Make sure BusyBox and wget are available
User: “I want that branch agent to have BusyBox and wget. Can you set that up?”

Assistant: “I’ll ask the Cmd Processor Expert to create a safe installer/runner, then execute it on the agent.”

We’ll first check what processors already exist.

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "message": "I am authorized to manage cmd processors on this agent. List available processors and their help output so I can see what is already installed."
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
Suppose the expert returns: no custom processors found. We’ll add a minimal “PkgOps” processor that can install BusyBox and wget using the system package manager.

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "message": "I am authorized to manage cmd processors on this agent. Create a new cmd processor named 'PkgOps' that can run safe package installs on Linux (apt/yum/apk). It should support commands: 'install busybox wget' and return exit code, stdout, stderr. Provide its help."
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
Assume the expert replies: “Processor PkgOps created. Usage: run 'PkgOps install busybox wget'.” Now we’ll run it to install both tools.

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "message": "I am authorized to perform this action. Run the 'PkgOps' processor with arguments: install busybox wget"
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
Expect success with package manager output. If wget or BusyBox are already present, the processor should report “already the newest version.”

Step 3 — Validate BusyBox on the agent
User: “Verify the agent can run interface and ping checks locally.”

Assistant: “Let’s use the agent’s BusyBox to confirm network status.” Note: Do not use BusyBox to connect to untrusted services.

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "command": "ip -br addr",
    "number_lines": 20
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
We expect a compact summary like:
- eth0 UP 192.168.10.25/24
- lo UNKNOWN 127.0.0.1/8

Now a basic reachability check to the gateway:

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "command": "ping -c 4 192.168.10.1",
    "number_lines": 50
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
We’ll see packet loss, latency, and jitter from inside the branch. This is exactly why on-site agents help—no WAN noise in your measurements.

Step 4 — Confirm wget works (HTTP probe from inside)
User: “Use wget to probe the intranet health endpoint.”

Assistant: “I’ll run wget via the Cmd Processor we set up.”

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_cmd_processor_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "message": "I am authorized to perform this action. Run 'PkgOps' with arguments: run `wget --spider -T 3 -t 1 http://intranet.local/healthz` and capture exit code and output."
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
If the health endpoint is reachable, wget returns HTTP 200/204 style status lines; timeouts or DNS failures will be visible immediately. This probe validates internal routing, DNS, and service health from within the LAN.

Step 5 — Bind monitoring jobs to your custom agent
User: “Great—now add continuous monitoring for the gateway and intranet web server, sourced from the branch agent.”

Assistant: “I’ll add an ICMP check for the gateway and an HTTP check for the intranet. Since this example isn’t logged in, I’ll include an email for alerts.”

We use add_host to create monitors and explicitly pin them to the agent location.

Function call (ICMP gateway)
```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "address": "192.168.10.1",
    "endpoint": "icmp",
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "email": "netops@example.com"
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
We receive a new host ID (e.g., id: 3112). The monitor starts probing the gateway from inside the branch.

Function call (HTTP intranet)
```json
{
  "name": "functions.add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "address": "intranet.local",
    "endpoint": "http",
    "port": 80,
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "email": "netops@example.com"
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
We receive another host ID (e.g., id: 3113). This will track page availability and response times, free from internet bottlenecks.

Step 6 — Verify the new monitors and read status
User: “Show me the latest status for intranet.local.”

Assistant: “I’ll fetch the most recent dataset.”

Function call
```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "dataset_id": 0,
    "address": "intranet.local"
  }
}
```

Interpreting the response
Expect fields like status UP/DOWN, average response time, agent location, and recent timestamps. If something looks off, we can pivot back to BusyBox for low-level checks.

Bonus: Run deeper on-site diagnostics when alerts fire
- Traceroute to intranet host: identify internal hops introducing latency.
- ARP/neighbor table checks: find duplicate IPs or stale entries.
- DNS lookups from the branch: confirm that internal DNS split-horizon is working.

Example BusyBox calls:
```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "command": "traceroute intranet.local",
    "number_lines": 100
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "agent_location": "Branch Office - Linux",
    "command": "arp -a",
    "number_lines": 50
  }
}
```

Interpreting the responses
- Traceroute shows where latency starts.
- ARP reveals MAC/IP associations; duplicates or incomplete entries can explain intermittent failures.

Why this approach works
- Custom agents bring your tools to the problem. You don’t wait on centralized scanners; you monitor and diagnose at the edge.
- BusyBox gives fast, familiar network commands. Combine with wget to validate HTTP endpoints and content reachability.
- Assisted automation lowers friction. The Quantum Network Monitor Assistant can set up processors, install tools, and bind monitors—all via a simple chat.

Try it yourself
- Open the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant and ask: “List my agents,” pick your closest site, then say: “Install BusyBox and wget on this agent.”
- Add monitors pinned to that agent: “Add ICMP for 192.168.10.1 from Branch Office - Linux,” and “Add HTTP for intranet.local:80 from Branch Office - Linux.”
- Validate with on-box commands: “Run BusyBox ip -br addr,” “Ping the gateway,” “Traceroute intranet.local.”

By coupling custom agents with on-box tools like BusyBox and wget, you gain precise, low-latency, inside-the-LAN visibility—and the ability to fix issues faster. Explore it now with the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant: https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open
