For teams looking to elevate their network monitoring beyond basic reachability or external checks, deploying a custom agent offers powerful advantages. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) empowers users to install custom monitoring agents on their own infrastructure, unlocking advanced diagnostics and seamless integration with local tools. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of custom agents and walk through a real-world example—enabling monitoring through classic tools like wget and BusyBox for local insights.

User: I want to monitor my internal network using BusyBox and custom commands. What’s the benefit of using a custom agent?

Assistant: Deploying a custom agent inside your network provides several advantages:
- You can monitor hosts behind firewalls or VPNs—cloud agents can’t reach these.
- Local monitoring allows you to run tools like ping, wget, and traceroute directly from within your private network.
- You’ll get detailed diagnostics (interface status, ARP tables, routing, etc.), useful for troubleshooting unique to your setup.

User: Great! How do I get started?

Assistant: First, you’ll want to install a Quantum Network Monitor agent on a machine in your network (for example, a Raspberry Pi, a Linux server, or even a Windows machine). Download the relevant agent from the official download page:

After installation, your agent will become available in the system. Let me show you how you can use it, especially for tasks with BusyBox and wget!

User: I just installed the agent. How do I use BusyBox to check my network interfaces?

Assistant: Let’s list available agents, so you can confirm your agent is visible:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": false
  }
}
```
Once we confirm your agent, we can remotely run BusyBox commands for diagnostics. For example, to check network interfaces:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "command": "ip -br addr",
    "agent_location": "YOUR_AGENT_LOCATION"
  }
}
```
This will give you a clean summary of all network interfaces and their IP addresses as seen by your custom agent. We used run_busybox_command here to utilize the agent’s direct access to your LAN.

User: Can I run a test file download from inside my network using wget, to see if an external site is reachable?

Assistant: Absolutely! While BusyBox covers internal diagnostics, your custom agent allows you to use wget or curl for real monitoring. For example, you can run wget to test connectivity or bandwidth to a specific site and retrieve logs for review and alerting.

Let’s run a wget command (note: use the actual tool installed on your agent; some agents support command execution via BusyBox, others may allow more):

```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "command": "wget -O /tmp/testfile.html http://example.com --timeout=10",
    "agent_location": "YOUR_AGENT_LOCATION"
  }
}
```
The assistant would show the result—whether the download succeeded, the response time, and any errors. This allows you to confirm real-world connectivity from inside your network perimeter, catching issues not visible from internet-based checks.

User: What about troubleshooting—can I run a traceroute to debug a slow connection?

Assistant: Yes! For traceroute, simply run:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.run_busybox_command",
  "arguments": {
    "command": "traceroute 8.8.8.8",
    "agent_location": "YOUR_AGENT_LOCATION"
  }
}
```
This traces the hops from your network up to a public DNS, helping you pinpoint routing issues or latency spikes.

User: How do I keep using these tools together in monitoring?

Assistant: With your custom agent deployed, you can script regular or on-demand checks using any combination of BusyBox, wget, and similar tools. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) leverages these built-in utilities through intuitive commands, providing visibility and custom diagnostics unmatched by generic online probes.

In summary, custom agents empower you to:
- Monitor internal and external network health, even behind firewalls
- Run classic diagnostics tools (BusyBox, wget, traceroute, etc.) from within your environment
- Gain actionable insights for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and alerting
