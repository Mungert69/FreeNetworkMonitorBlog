Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the world of network operations. As organizations face increasing complexity, new threats, and a need for constant uptime, AI-driven tools can automate, optimize, and secure networks in ways that were once unimaginable. With the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant, users can already catch a glimpse of this exciting future—today.

Let’s walk through a blog-style example of how the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant can be used to illustrate, step by step, some of the key trends predicted for network management over the next five years.

Imagine you’re a network administrator preparing your organization for the future. You want to:

1. Automate discovery and management of networked assets.
2. Use predictive analytics for proactive issue resolution.
3. Integrate security intelligence into routine monitoring.
4. Harness easy natural language interactions for fast action.

Here’s how that scenario might play out.

Step 1: Automated Asset Discovery

User: “Assistant, show me a summary of all devices currently monitored in our network.”

Assistant:

To respond, the assistant issues a call to retrieve all monitored hosts:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_list",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

The assistant receives a detailed list of all hosts and presents the findings clearly: “Here are your currently monitored devices, including their status and the monitoring methods applied. Would you like to add a new device?”

Step 2: Predictive Analytics for Proactive Issue Resolution

User: “I’d like to know which hosts have shown abnormal patterns or could be at risk based on recent data trends.”

Assistant:

Automatic pattern recognition is essential for the future. The assistant retrieves recent monitoring data to spot anomalies:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.get_host_data",
  "arguments": {
    "detail_response": true,
    "alert_flag": true,
    "dataset_id": 0
  }
}
```

The function call collects the latest alert data, flagging any hosts with abnormal activity. The assistant summarizes: “These hosts have triggered alerts in the last 24 hours. Would you like to see recommended remediation steps?”

Step 3: Integrating Security Intelligence Into Routine Monitoring

User: “Can we run a quick security assessment on our primary web server, using modern standards?”

Assistant:

The assistant proposes an on-demand security check, aligning with predicted needs for always-on, integrated security. It asks for the relevant agent location and proceeds:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Run an SSL/TLS configuration check and vulnerability scan for host mainweb.corp.com. Confirmed as authorized.",
    "agent_location": "Scanner - EU"
  }
}
```

After running the scan, the assistant reviews the findings: “Your server’s SSL certificate is valid, but there’s an outdated protocol enabled. Would you like recommended remediation steps or an explanation of the vulnerabilities?”

Step 4: Seamless Natural Language Management

User: “Move monitoring of our test server from HTTP ping to full quantum-secure endpoint checking.”

Assistant:

Effortless network changes are a core prediction for the next decade. The assistant edits the host’s monitoring profile:

```json
{
  "name": "functions.edit_host",
  "arguments": {
    "address": "testserver.corp.com",
    "endpoint": "quantum",
    "detail_response": true
  }
}
```

The system confirms: “The test server will now be checked using quantum-safe methods, increasing your resilience against future threats.”

Closing

As we can see, the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant already supports the foundations of what experts predict for the next five years of network operations:

- Automating routine tasks and asset management
- Predictive alerting and analytics
- Integrated security as part of daily operations
- Human-friendly, conversational interfaces

By using simple, secure, and powerful function calls, you can ensure your network is ready for the future—today.
