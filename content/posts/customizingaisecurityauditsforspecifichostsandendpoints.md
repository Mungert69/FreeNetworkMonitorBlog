questions:
  - "What is the difference between a host and an endpoint in network security?"
  - "How do I add a new host for monitoring using the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant?"
  - "Can I customize security scans based on different endpoint types?"
  - "What role does the agent location play in security assessments?"
  - "How do I request a specific security scan like a Nmap vulnerability scan?"
answers:
  - "A host refers to any device that is part of your network, while endpoints are specific services or applications running on those devices."
  - "You can add a new host by using the add_host function, providing details such as the host address, endpoint type, port, timeout, your email for alerts, and the agent location."
  - "Yes, the Quantum Network Monitor Assistant allows you to tailor scans based on endpoint types, such as running vulnerability scans on web servers or SSL configuration checks on email servers."
  - "Agent location specifies where the monitoring agent is based, which can be important for compliance, latency, or regional security considerations when conducting scans and assessments."
  - "After adding the host, you can request a specific scan by sending a message with the scan type and host details, along with the agent location, which the assistant will communicate to the security expert."

When it comes to network security, customizing your security audits based on specific hosts and endpoint configurations is essential. The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) enables you to tailor scans and assessments efficiently. In this post, we’ll walk you through how to do just that, ensuring that you can maximize the effectiveness of your security assessments.

### Understanding Your Hosts and Endpoints

First, let’s clarify what we mean by hosts and endpoints. A host refers to any device that is part of your network, while endpoints are specific services or applications running on those devices. With the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), you can conduct targeted security audits based on various attributes like host types, endpoint types, and agent locations.

### Step 1: Adding a New Host for Monitoring

To start monitoring a new host, you will use the `add_host` function. For example, let's say you want to monitor a web server located at `example.com` that uses HTTPS. This server might have a unique security profile that requires a specific assessment.

**User:** I want to add a new host for monitoring.  
**Assistant:** Let’s add your web server located at `example.com`. Please provide your email for alerts as well as the agent location. 

**User:** My email is user@example.com, and I'll use the "US-based agent."  

**Function Call:**
```json
{
  "detail_response": false,
  "address": "example.com",
  "endpoint": "https",
  "port": 443,
  "timeout": 59000,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "agent_location": "US-based agent"
}
```
```

**Assistant:** The host has been successfully added for monitoring. Now, let's proceed to set up a customized security assessment on this host.

### Step 2: Customizing Your Security Audit 

Now that your host is being monitored, you can tailor specific scans. Suppose you want to conduct a vulnerability scan using Nmap.

**User:** I need to run a vulnerability scan on `example.com`.  
**Assistant:** I will set up a request for a security assessment using Nmap. 

**Function Call:**
```json
{
  "message": "Please run a Nmap vulnerability scan on the host example.com.",
  "agent_location": "US-based agent"
}
```
```

**Assistant:** The request for a Nmap vulnerability scan has been communicated to the security expert. You will receive alerts regarding the findings.

### Step 3: Tailoring Scans Based on Endpoint Types

Let’s say you have another host that’s an email server, and you need to conduct SSL configuration checks. Here’s how you can specify the endpoint.

**User:** Now, I want to check the SSL configuration for my email server at `mail.example.com`.  
**Assistant:** I’ll add this as a separate host for monitoring. Please provide necessary details like your email and agent location.

**User:** My email remains the same, and I'll use the "EU-based agent" this time.  

**Function Call:**
```json
{
  "detail_response": false,
  "address": "mail.example.com",
  "endpoint": "smtp",
  "port": 25,
  "timeout": 59000,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "agent_location": "EU-based agent"
}
```
```

**Assistant:** The email server host has been added. Now, let’s initiate the SSL configuration check.

**Function Call:**
```json
{
  "message": "Please perform an SSL/TLS configuration check on mail.example.com.",
  "agent_location": "EU-based agent"
}
```
```

**Assistant:** I've communicated the request for the SSL configuration check, and you should receive the results soon.
