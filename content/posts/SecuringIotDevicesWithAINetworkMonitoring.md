In today’s connected world, smart thermostats, cameras, locks, and other IoT (Internet of Things) devices have become part of our everyday routines. But these devices can also open the door to potential vulnerabilities, as they often lack the robust security protections found on traditional computers. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how the Free Network Monitor Assistant can help identify and secure these smart devices on your network—using easy, AI-powered dialogue and automated monitoring.

Let’s look at a typical scenario, where a user wants to scan their network for vulnerable IoT devices and then keep tabs on them with active monitoring and security checks.

---

User: I have a bunch of smart home devices—cameras, plugs, a thermostat. How can I make sure they aren’t vulnerable?

Assistant: Great question! The first step is to identify all the devices active on your network and then set up continuous monitoring for unusual or insecure activity. Let’s start by listing the devices you want to check. If you aren’t sure of all their IP addresses, you might start by checking your home router’s “Connected Devices” page or using a mobile network scan app.

User: Here’s a list of IP addresses and device types:
- 192.168.1.10 (Smart Plug)
- 192.168.1.15 (Security Camera)
- 192.168.1.20 (Smart Thermostat)

Assistant: Perfect! Let’s add these devices to the Free Network Monitor so we can monitor their network status and run some security checks. I’ll set up simple “ICMP” (ping) checks to confirm each device is reachable, and also prepare for security scans.

First, I’ll add the devices for monitoring:
```json


{
  "name": "add_host",
  "arguments": {
    "address": "192.168.1.10",
    "endpoint": "icmp",
    "detail_response": true,
    "email": "your@email.com" // You’ll be prompted for this if not logged in
  }
}
```

And similarly for the other IPs.

After calling the add_host function for each device, the assistant would confirm each is successfully monitored and visible in your dashboard:

The add_host function sets up active network monitoring for each smart device using ICMP (ping). This lets the assistant alert you if any of the devices goes offline or starts behaving erratically—an early warning sign for compromise or malfunction.

User: Can you check if any of these devices are exposing vulnerable services?

Assistant: Absolutely. Let’s perform a targeted security assessment on each one. For IoT devices, the most common vulnerabilities are open ports (like Telnet, SSH, or unsecured web interfaces). I can initiate an Nmap scan through our Security Expert agent to look for exposed services.
```json


{
  "name": "call_security_expert",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "Perform a basic Nmap scan for open ports and known vulnerabilities on 192.168.1.10. Confirm authorization for this action.",
    "agent_location": "[Your Local Agent Name]" 
  }
}
```

This scan will be repeated for each device. The assistant then interprets the scan results, highlighting any ports or services that pose a security risk, such as an open Telnet or HTTP admin interface.

---

User: What if a device is found to have open ports that shouldn’t be there?

Assistant: If a device exposes a potentially risky port or service, I’ll provide a summary like this:

“Security Camera (192.168.1.15) is exposing a Telnet service on port 23, which is a well-known vulnerability. It’s recommended to disable Telnet in the device’s admin interface, update firmware, or firewall this port from access.”

You can take action by accessing the device’s settings via its web or mobile interface, or by segmenting it on your network to limit exposure. If you want, I can assist with follow-up scans to confirm remediation.

---

User: Can you keep monitoring these devices and let me know if new risks appear?

Assistant: Yes! The Free Network Monitor Assistant will continuously monitor each device for connectivity and response time issues. If anything changes (like new open ports, unusual uptime, or unreachable status), you’ll receive an alert by email.

You can also periodically re-run security scans to check for new vulnerabilities—especially after firmware updates or network changes.

In conclusion, the Free Network Monitor Assistant makes it easy to bring enterprise-grade oversight to your smart home or office. By adding each IoT device, scheduling security checks, and automating alerts, you can proactively safeguard your network against evolving threats. Ready to get started?
