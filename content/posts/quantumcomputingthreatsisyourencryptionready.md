questions:
  - "Which parts of our stack are actually vulnerable to quantum attacks, and what remains viable?"
  - "How does Quantum Network Monitor find quantum‑vulnerable crypto without decrypting traffic or installing agents?"
  - "What is a hybrid post‑quantum rollout, and why use it?"
  - "What should our first 90 days look like with QNM?"
  - "How do we handle third‑party TLS termination and HNDL backup/export flows?"
answers:
  - "Public‑key crypto based on RSA and elliptic‑curve schemes (ECC) breaks under Shor’s algorithm. That impacts TLS certificate/signature chains, SSH host keys, IKEv2 authentication, S/MIME/PGP, code signing, and many update paths. Symmetric ciphers (like AES) and hashes (like SHA‑2) remain viable but should use stronger parameters (e.g., 256‑bit keys). Because adversaries can harvest now and decrypt later (HNDL), the risk is present today."
  - "QNM passively observes network handshakes via sensors or SPAN taps and extracts metadata: protocol versions (TLS 1.0–1.3, QUIC, SSH, IPsec/IKEv2, etc.), key exchanges, signature algorithms, certificate chains, key sizes, and expirations. It builds a cryptographic bill of materials per asset and flags where sensitive data flows—no active interception, endpoint agents, or payload decryption required."
  - "Hybrid means combining post‑quantum algorithms with classical ones for compatibility and risk reduction. For TLS, that typically involves PQ key establishment (e.g., ML‑KEM in a hybrid mode) and hybrid certificate signatures (e.g., ML‑DSA plus ECDSA). QNM helps you canary endpoints, measure client success, rotate short‑lived certs, adopt PQ‑ready CAs, and continuously verify that real traffic negotiates the intended PQ or hybrid modes before global cutover."
  - "Days 0–30: Deploy passive sensors; baseline TLS/SSH/IPsec/email; identify HNDL‑risk flows and external services; freeze new long‑lived RSA/ECDSA certs; shorten lifetimes; generate an exposure brief. Days 31–60: Pilot hybrid PQ on a low‑risk external service; replace SSH RSA host keys on internal admin targets; update IKEv2 away from RSA auth; add CI checks to block new classical‑only certs. Days 61–90: Expand hybrid PQ to customer‑facing APIs and critical services; rotate code‑signing toward PQ‑safe options as toolchains allow; enforce policy in QNM (alert on classical‑only signatures and non‑hybrid KEM); track readiness with the QNM score."
  - "QNM automatically flags external‑facing and third‑party‑terminated TLS, plus off‑net data flows with classical‑only signatures. For remediation, require vendors/CDNs to support hybrid PQ TLS or terminate TLS under your control with PQ/hybrid; stop issuing long‑lived RSA/ECDSA certs; route backups/exports over PQ or hybrid channels; and use QNM’s Assistant to generate targeted change tickets and executive‑ready reports to track closure."

The headlines are right: large-scale quantum computers will break the public‑key cryptography that underpins your TLS, VPNs, SSH, PKI, and code signing. The better question is: how much of your environment actually relies on those vulnerable primitives—and how fast can you move to quantum‑safe replacements?

This is where knowing beats guessing. With Quantum Network Monitor (QNM), you can inventory every cryptographic dependency across your network, prioritize the risks that matter, and navigate a staged migration with confidence. And with the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open), you can turn those findings into precise queries, remediation plans, and executive‑ready reports in minutes.

## The quantum threat in plain terms

- What breaks: RSA and elliptic‑curve cryptography (ECC) fall to Shor’s algorithm. That affects TLS server certs and signatures, SSH host keys, IKEv2 authentication, S/MIME/PGP, code signing, and many device/firmware update paths.
- What bends: Symmetric crypto (AES) and hashes (SHA‑2) remain viable, but you should plan for stronger parameters (for example, 256‑bit symmetric keys).
- Why this matters now: Adversaries can harvest encrypted traffic and stored data today and decrypt it later when quantum capabilities arrive (harvest‑now, decrypt‑later).

NIST has selected quantum‑resistant algorithms (e.g., ML‑KEM for key establishment and ML‑DSA for signatures, commonly known by their submission names). Migration is a multi‑year journey; your readiness depends on what you’re actually using on the wire.

## You can’t fix what you can’t see

Common blind spots:
- TLS 1.2 services with RSA certificates and signatures
- TLS 1.3 services still using classical-only certificate signatures
- VPNs and Wi‑Fi using RSA/ECDSA for authentication
- SSH hosts using RSA/ECDSA host keys
- Third‑party APIs and CDNs that terminate TLS on your behalf
- Backup exports and data sync jobs leaving the network over quantum‑vulnerable channels (prime HNDL targets)

Quantum Network Monitor eliminates guesswork by passively mapping cryptography across your environment: protocols, ciphers, key exchanges, signature algorithms, certificate chains, key lengths, and where sensitive data actually flows.

## How Quantum Network Monitor helps, step by step

1) Discover and baseline
- Passive network discovery for TLS (1.0–1.3), QUIC, SSH, IPsec/IKEv2, DNSSEC, S/MIME, MQTT/AMQP, RDP, and more
- Parse X.509 chains, signature algorithms, key sizes, and lifetimes
- Identify HNDL‑risk flows: off‑net destinations, backups, archives, and data exporters
- Produce a cryptographic bill of materials (C‑BoM) for each asset and service

2) Quantify exposure and prioritize
- Risk scoring focused on quantum impact and data sensitivity
- External‑facing and third‑party‑terminated TLS identified automatically
- SLA/owner tagging for targeted remediation
- Executive dashboards and auditor‑ready evidence mapped to policy baselines

3) Migrate and validate
- Plan hybrid rollouts (classical + PQ) to de‑risk compatibility
- Canary test endpoints and measure client success rates before global cutover
- Certificate lifecycle hygiene: rotate short‑lived certs, purge RSA/ECDSA where feasible, adopt PQ‑ready CAs
- Continuous verification: confirm real traffic is using the intended PQ or hybrid modes

## Ask the Assistant to accelerate every step

The [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) turns findings into action.

- Query your posture in plain language:
  - “Show all external TLS services with RSA or ECDSA cert signatures.”
  - “Which SSH hosts still present RSA host keys?”
  - “List IKEv2 tunnels authenticated with RSA and their peer orgs.”

- Generate targeted remediation:
  - “Create a 30‑day plan to migrate Customer API to hybrid PQ TLS with a canary rollout.”
  - “Draft change tickets for replacing RSA host keys with PQ‑ready alternatives on fleet ‘payments-*’.”

- Produce executive and audit‑ready outputs:
  - “Summarize quantum risk to PCI‑scoped systems in one page with a readiness score.”

Example readiness metric pulled via API and ready for a board deck:

```json

  "org": "acme-corp",
  "pq_readiness": {
    "score": 0.46,
    "scale": "0.0–1.0",
    "coverage": {
      "tls": 0.52,
      "ssh": 0.31,
      "ipsec": 0.44,

## A practical 30/60/90‑day quantum‑safe plan with QNM

- Days 0–30: See it
  - Deploy passive sensors or SPAN taps; baseline TLS, SSH, IPsec, email
  - Identify HNDL‑risk flows and external‑facing services
  - Freeze long‑lived RSA/ECDSA cert issuance; shorten lifetimes where feasible
  - Use the Assistant to generate an exposure brief for leadership

- Days 31–60: Stabilize it
  - Pilot hybrid PQ for a low‑risk external service; measure client success rates
  - Replace SSH RSA host keys on internal SRE/admin endpoints
  - Update IKEv2 profiles away from RSA auth; validate interop
  - Build CI checks to block regressions (no new RSA/ECDSA certs without exception)

- Days 61–90: Scale it
  - Expand hybrid PQ to customer‑facing APIs and critical internal services
  - Rotate code‑signing chains toward quantum‑safe options as toolchains allow
  - Enforce policy in QNM: alert on classical‑only signatures and non‑hybrid KEM
  - Publish your PQC roadmap and track readiness with the QNM score

## Common pitfalls QNM helps you avoid

- “TLS 1.3 means I’m safe.” TLS 1.3 still uses classical signatures by default; the certificate’s signature algorithm matters.
- “Our vendor handles TLS.” Third‑party termination inherits their risk. QNM verifies what’s actually negotiated on the wire.
- “We’ll flip a switch later.” Certificate and key lifecycles take time; hybrid and canary phases reduce breakage.
- “No one would want our data.” HNDL makes even boring data valuable later; stop the quiet exports now.

## Bottom line

Quantum risk isn’t a future problem—it’s a visibility problem. When you can see every vulnerable signature, handshake, and data flow, the path to quantum‑safe becomes obvious and manageable. Quantum Network Monitor provides that visibility and continuous verification, while the [Quantum Network Monitor Assistant](https://readyforquantum.com/?assistant=open) turns insights into action plans, tickets, and reports. Start now, measure continuously, and make “quantum‑ready” a tracked, provable state—not a promise.
